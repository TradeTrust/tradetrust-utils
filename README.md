# tradetrust-utils
This is a repository that houses shared project logic between tradetrust website and tradetrust document creator.

Currently, this is still an experiment to see whether this structure of sharing logic between the 2 repos is sustainable.

We will monitor whether the dependencies will get out of hand.

Before any commits here, please ask the maintainers (TradeTrust team) first.
